Timothy,

- Congratulations on passing the judge Kattis!

However, 

- You are using tabs! You must use two-space indentation.

- The program is missing the header specified in the style guidelines:
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

- Please read the style guidelines to make sure you understand them. Do not
  hesitate to ask any questions.

- Your repository is not organized!!! Why is Project 0 in a folder
  "Desktop/SD1" and on another called "SD1" with the wrong code? Points will be
  deducted if this organization persists. It is in your best interest that I find
  your work. I was going to give you a zero because it was the wrong code in
  "SD1/".

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
